# Majority Algorithms

Implementations of algorithms for finding the majority element in a stream:

- [x] MJRTY: [MJRTY - A Fast Majority Vote Algorithm](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.56.3439)
- [x] Fisher-Salzberg: [Finding a Majority Among N Votes](http://www.cs.yale.edu/publications/techreports/tr252.pdf)
- [ ] Matula Tournament: [An Optimal Algorithm for the Majority Element Problem](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=870753)

I was inspired to look at these algorithms after reading the paper [Revisiting the Majority Problem: Average-Case Analysis with Arbitrarily Many Colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05123).
